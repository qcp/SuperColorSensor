<p>
The Color Sensor RGB Block uses the standard LEGO&reg; MINDSTORMS&reg; EV3
Color Sensor to measure color using RGB color values. You can use this block
to detect colors other than the standard LEGO brick colors that are supported
by the <b>Measure - Color</b> mode of the standard Color Sensor Block.
<br><br>
This block was created by David Gilday for MindCub3r, the EV3
Rubik's Cube&reg; solver robot.
<br><br>
Note: this block may not work as intended with some versions of the EV3
firmware. Please see the

<h2>Modes</h2>
<a name="Mode_ReadRGB"></a>
<h3>Measure - RGB color</h3>
<p>
This mode returns the Red, Green and Blue components of the RGB color.
</p>
<h2>Parameters</h2>
<a name="Parameters"></a>
<h3>Port, Red, Green, Blue</h3>
<p>
Set <b>Port</b> to match input port on the EV3 to which the Color Sensor
is connected.
<br><br>
Use <b>Red, Green</b> and <b>Blue</b> to read the values of the three color
components from the measured RGB color. Each value is in the range 0 thru 255
indicating how much of the color component is present in the measured color.
The larger the number, the more of that component is present.
